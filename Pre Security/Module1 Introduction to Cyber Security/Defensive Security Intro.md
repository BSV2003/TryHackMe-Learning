# Defensive Security Intro
Introducing defensive security and related topics, such as Threat Intelligence, SOC, DFIR, Malware Analysis, and SIEM.

## What is Defensive Security?

Defensive Security focuses on **protecting systems, networks, and data** from cyber attacks.  
It works as the counterpart to offensive security.

The two primary objectives of defensive security are:
- **Preventing intrusions** from occurring
- **Detecting intrusions** when they occur and responding effectively

Defensive security is mainly handled by **Blue Teams**.

### Relationship with Offensive Security

In the previous lesson, offensive security focused on:
- Exploiting software vulnerabilities
- Leveraging insecure configurations
- Abusing weak or unenforced access control policies

These activities are typically performed by **Red Teams** and **Penetration Testers**.

Defensive security uses the knowledge of these attack techniques to **build stronger defenses**.

### Core Defensive Security Tasks

#### 🛡️ User Cyber Security Awareness
- Training users to recognize phishing, malware, and social engineering attacks
- Reduces human-based security risks

#### 🗂️ Asset Documentation and Management
- Identifying and maintaining an inventory of systems and devices
- Helps ensure all assets are properly protected

#### 🔄 Updating and Patching Systems
- Applying security updates to operating systems, applications, and network devices
- Prevents exploitation of known vulnerabilities

#### 🔥 Preventative Security Controls
- **Firewalls**: Control incoming and outgoing network traffic
- **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**: Block traffic matching known attack signatures

#### 📊 Logging and Monitoring
- Collecting logs from systems and networks
- Detecting unauthorized access or suspicious activity
- Enables faster incident response

## Areas of Defensive Security

Defensive security covers multiple domains focused on **preventing, detecting, analyzing, and responding** to cyber threats.  
This task introduces two major areas:
- Security Operations Center (SOC) & Threat Intelligence
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), including Malware Analysis
